# euler93

Solution to [Project Euler Problem 93][1] in Haskell.

To run, compile with ghc and execute. It will expect two lines, in
accodance with the spec set forth by shashank21j in [[2]][2]: the first
line is ignored, and the second line is a space-seperated list of
positiveintegers. Output will be (should be) the largest positive
integer such it and all smaller positive integers are obtainable from
our input list and the four arithmetic operations, or zero if there is
no positive integers can be generated from our list.

trees in [[4]][4].
